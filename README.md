# Machine Learning Progress

A personal learning repository where I work through core machine learning concepts with hands-on notebooks and projects.

## Overview

This folder tracks my progress understanding ML fundamentals—from exploratory data analysis through regression and classification. Each lecture folder contains Jupyter notebooks and datasets used for practice.

## Repository Structure

| Lecture | Topic | Contents |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **01** | Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) | Data cleaning, EDA projects (Insurance, Heart), sample datasets |
| **02** | Simple Linear Regression | Single-feature regression with salary data |
| **03** | SGD Regression | Stochastic gradient descent regression |
| **04** | Multi-Linear Regression | Multiple features, Car Price assignment |
| **05** | Polynomial Linear Regression | Polynomial features, ice cream sales data |
| **06** | Ridge & Lasso Regression | Regularization (Ridge, Lasso), experience–salary data |
| **07** | Logistic Regression | Binary and multiclass classification |

## Tech Stack

- **Python** (Jupyter notebooks)
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
- **Environment:** See `requirement.txt` for dependencies

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo** (if applicable):
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd Machine_Learning
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirement.txt
   ```

4. **Run notebooks**:
   Open any `.ipynb` file in Jupyter Notebook/Lab or VS Code and run the cells.

## Notes

- Datasets (CSV files) are included in each lecture folder where needed.
- Notebooks are meant for learning and experimentation; adjust paths or data as needed for your setup.
